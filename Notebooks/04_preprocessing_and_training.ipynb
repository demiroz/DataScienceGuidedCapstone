    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

But this is  a common task so there's a built in function in `sklearn`. This is [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html).\n",
    "This takes the pipeline object, in fact it takes anything with a `.fit()` and `.predict()` method. In simple cases with no feature selection or imputation or feature scaling etc. you may see the classifier or regressor object itself directly passed into `GridSearchCV`. The other key input is the parameters and values to search over. Optional parameters include the cross-validation strategy and number of CPUs to use."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I separated the Big Mountain Resort row from the  data and saved as a separate item. \n",
    "Next, I partitioned the data in train set and test set for the feature columns (X) and target column (Y) with a 70/30 split ratio (70% training set, 30% test set).\n",
    "Then I dropped the categorical variables (i.e.,  ‘Name’, ’State’, ‘Region) from my dataset. With this step, only integer and float features were left in the train and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Initial Attempts***\n",
    "\n",
    "After splitting the data into training and test groups, I started playing around with different prediction methods. \n",
    "The first thing I did was to use the mean as a predictor. The mean score for y_train (i.e., the target value in the training set) was 63.811.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Metrics***\n",
    "\n",
    "R2 \n",
    "I used R2  as my first metric for assessing the model quality. R2 is also known as the coefficient of determination. It shows how much variance in  y is explained by predictor variables. I created a function named “r_squared” to calculate the R2  value for any given X and y inputs. \n",
    "I then used the mean score for y_train on y_test as a predictor variable and received R2 = -.0031\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "The next metric I used was mean absolute error (MAE). I wrote a function to calculate the MAE for any given inputs. I used the MAE function on “y_train ~ y_tr_pred” and “y_test ~ y_te_pred”. The results were 17.92 and 19.13 respectively. \n",
    "MAE is one of the most intuitive metrics. The results show that on average, we might expect to be off by around $19 if I guessed the ticket price based on an average of known values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "The third metric I used was mean squared error (MSE). MSE is the average of the square of errors and it is an important metric for optimizing ML models. I wrote a function for calculating the MSE and used the function on “y_train ~y_tr_pred” and “y_test ~ y_te_pred”. The results were 614.133 and 581.43 respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "sklearn Metrics \n",
    "In addition the R2 , MAE, and MSE, I used sklearn metrics, which are the same with the functions I wrote. sklearn saves us from writing above-mentioned functions every time we build a ML model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Initial Models***\n",
    "\n",
    "After I explored model assessment metrics, I moved on to building initial models. \n",
    "The first thing to in building a model is imputing missing values in the dataset. There are different ways to impute missing values. The most common ones are replacing the missing values with the mean and median values of the feature.\n",
    "Because we know that distribution of features are skewed, median imputation is a more appropriate method for replacing missing values. \n",
    "Next, I scaled my data with mean = 0 and std= 1. \n",
    "After imputing and scaling the data, I ran my first multiple linear regression models on scaled my training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "lm = LinearRegression().fit(X_tr_scaled, y_train)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, created two objects named  y_tr_pred and y_te_pred. These two objects are products of using scaled training values for training and test sets on the lm object ( y_tr_pred = lm.predict(X_tr_scaled); y_te_pred = lm.predict(X_te_scaled). \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting R2  values are 81% and -0.075%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I calculated MAE and MSE scores for the same variables (i.e., (y_train, y_tr_pred) and (y_test, y_te_pred).\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE: \t8.54, \t11.69\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE: \t111.88, \t623.19\n",
    "\n",
    "After building my initial model by imputing missing values with median, I replicated the same procedures using mean as my imputation method. \n",
    "\n",
    "I received the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "R2    :  \t81.8%\t -20.54%\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE:  \t8.53\t\t 11.88\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE:  \t112.36\t 698.7\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that Imputing missing values using median or mean does not make dramatic changes in R2 , MAE, and MSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Pipelines***\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing initial models, calculating model fitness measures, scaling data, and using different data imputation methods are demanding tasks especially when they are replicated multiple times. sklearn’s pipeline function automates these steps and makes model development and testing a lot more quick. In the following steps, I used pipelines to  automate these steps and refined my model. \n",
    "\n",
    "I defined a pipeline that automated data imputation ,scaling, and model fitting. Additionally, I added SelectKBest tool in sklearn in my pipeline to refine my model. SelectKBest function helps us determine how many features we need to keep in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "I calculated the R2  and MAE  using the pipeline I defined.  \n",
    "R2    :  \t76.74%\t\t-12.22%\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE:  \t9.50\t\t\t13.41\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I used the pipeline again, this time changing the k value in SelectKBest to 15 (default us 10). \n",
    "R2    :  \t79,24%\t\t-69,67%\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE: \t9.21\t\t\t13.45\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Cross Validation***\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the k value generates somewhat different results in model fit metrics. However, keep tying arbitrary hyperparameter values may not be a good practice since we might be creating a model that works great on our training data but perform poorly on other datasets. Therefore, we need to cross-validate the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this, cross validated the pipeline for k=15 (i.e., SelectKBest hyperparameter) on five different sections of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "mean cv scores: \t0.6327\n",
    "\n",
    "cv scores std: \t0.095\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearch CV\n",
    "Next, I cross validated multiple k values for the SelectKBest function. The result was k=8. \n",

    "’SkiableTerrain_ac’ \n",
    "are the best predicting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Random Forest Model***\n",
    "\n",
    "I used sklearn’s RandomForestRegresssor class to run a random forest analysis. \n",
    "I created a pipeline for running the analysis. \n",
    "I used grid search cross validation in the pipeline. \n",
    "The random forest model shows that using the median for imputation works better than the mean while scaling does not work very well.\n",
    "The random tree model identified \n",
    "‘fastQuads’\n",
    "‘runs’\n",
    "‘Snow Making_ac’ and\n",
    "‘Vertical_drop’\n",
    "as the most dominant features. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Final Model Selection***\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare which model is better, I compared the mean absolute error of the linear regression model and random forest model. \n",
    "The regression model had\n",
    "MAE mean: \t\t10.49\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE std: \t\t1.62\n",
    "\n",

    "The random forest model had\n",
    "MAE mean: \t\t9.58\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE std:\t\t\t1.38\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE for X_test:\t9.5\n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest model has lower cross - validation mean absolute error by almost $5 for the X_test dataset, which is a noticeable difference. It also has a smaller std, which means it has less variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Data Quantity Assessment***\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I checked whether using more data would be necessary for making a healthy inference for an accurate business decision. \n",
    "I created a learning curve to see how many training set size would yield the best CV scores. The graph shows that the data I have is sufficient and there is not need for additional data. \n",
